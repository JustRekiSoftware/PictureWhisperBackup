# PictureWhisper
First try to code an UWP app (for my graduation design)

# Introduction
UWP as Client, ASP.NET Core Web Api to provide data

SQL Server to save record, SQLite to save app settings

IdentityServer 4 to protect web api (using ClientCredential)

MVVM and DataBinding, EFcore

Marduk.Controls is used in this app
(the github link: https://github.com/ProjectMarduk/Marduk.Controls)
